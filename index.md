            <section id="aboutMe">

                <p> I am from California and enjoy warm weather and the sun. I also love rain too as I now live in Oregon. Hiking with my dogs is one of my favorite past times as well as playing games like Magic The Gathering. I play guitar but do not abide by a playing style, I enjoy a free style approach. My hopes and dreams are to begin a coding career with the help of my handy computer.
